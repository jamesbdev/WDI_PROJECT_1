# WDI-PROJECT-1
This is my first project for the Web Development Immersive course at General Assembly.

This is a memory game where the user matches sounds. There are 10 sounds for the users to match. When two sounds are matched, the squares light up to signal that a match has been found.

I used HTML to create content, CSS to style  and JavaScript to manipulate the DOM. I used the theme of Psy's Gangnam style for the styling and sounds.

When the user maches two sounds together, the relevant squares light up:

I edited the track from Psy's Gangnam style to find interesting breaks.

On/off function for background music.
